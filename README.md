SolrSearchSanitizer
===================

A gem to provide a way of sanitizing SOLR searches containing advanced search characters and nested parentheses.  This gem assumes that ECommerce stores do not advertise this advanced functionality of SOLR to users and so the query must be sanitized to prevent incorrect syntax.
